This is a full stack app that is designe to scrape the front page of reddit and display each result as a card on the page in descending (or ascending...I can't ever get that right) order by date it was scraped. This app aslo allows you to save certain posts to another page and then save notes about that story if you want. If this is no longer interesting, it can be removed from the save page and sent back to the home page that displays all posts. There is also a page that shows which subreddits ar the most commonly appearing on the front page of reddit. As of March 24, 2018, the most common subreddit is [r/aww](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww), which continues the theory that the thing the internet cares most about is cats.
